# Fujin

Fujin is a blazingly fast broker connector that bridges your applications with any message broker through a unified, efficient protocol. It translates between a custom byte-based protocol and various messaging systems, aiming to provide a seamless experience regardless of the underlying broker.

> **Note**: This project was created mostly for learning purposes, and it might not be usefull for anyone at all. Experimental. Not production ready.

## Pitch

Modern distributed systems often need to work with multiple message brokers, each with its own protocol and quirks. Here are some core features:

- **Unified Protocol**: A single, efficient byte-based protocol for all your messaging needs
- **Zero Broker Lock-in**: Switch between brokers without changing your application code
- **Dual Message Delivery Models**:
  - Push: Server pushes messages to clients
  - Pull: Clients request messages from server (not for all brokers)
- **Transaction Support**: Atomic message production across multiple topics (not for all brokers)
- **Blazing Speed & Efficiency**: Optimized for processing large volumes of messages efficiently, leveraging techniques like zero-allocation parsing.
- **QUIC Transport**: Reliable, multiplexed communication with built-in security
- **gRPC Interface**: Modern, language-agnostic RPC interface for easy integration
- **Keep-Alive Mechanism**: Automatic connection health monitoring

## Supported Protocols

- Kafka
- NATS Core
- AMQP 0.9.1 (RabbitMQ)
- AMQP 1.0 (Azure Service Bus, Apache ActiveMQ)
- RESP (PubSub/Streams)
- NSQ
- MQTT

## Client Interfaces
Fujin provides two client interfaces to suit different needs:

### Fujin Native Protocol (QUIC)
Optimized binary protocol with minimal overhead. Best for high-performance applications. Only Go client is supporter right now.

### gRPC Interface
Easy to use, works with any language that supports gRPC.

## Use Cases

Fujin is particularly useful for:

- Microservices architectures integrating diverse messaging backends.
- Systems migrating between message brokers with minimal application changes.
- Applications requiring a unified messaging API across different cloud providers or on-premise systems.
- Scenarios demanding high-throughput message processing.

## When to Use Fujin

Fujin is most valuable in these scenarios:

- **Multiple Broker Environment**: When your system needs to work with different message brokers simultaneously
- **Unified Interface Needed**: When you want a single protocol interface across different brokers

## When Not to Use Fujin

Consider alternatives if:

- **Single Broker**: You're only using one message broker
- **Minimal Layers**: You want to minimize the number of components in your architecture
- **Ultra-Low Latency**: When every microsecond counts and you can't afford additional overhead
- **Broker-Specific Features**: When you need direct access to broker-specific features

## Build Options

### Server Build

The server uses Go build tags to conditionally compile features:

**Available Build Tags:**
- **Broker Connectors**: `kafka`, `nats_core`, `amqp091`, `amqp10`, `resp_pubsub`, `resp_streams`, `mqtt`, `nsq`
- **Observability**: `observability` - Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry tracing
- **gRPC**: `grpc` - gRPC server implementation

**Building the server:**

```bash
# Build with all features (default)
make build

# Build with specific connectors only
make build GO_BUILD_TAGS="kafka,nats_core"

# Build with gRPC support
make build GO_BUILD_TAGS="kafka,grpc"

# Build minimal (no observability, no gRPC)
make build GO_BUILD_TAGS="kafka"

# Or use go build directly
cd server && go build -tags="kafka,grpc" -o ../bin/fujin ./cmd
```
